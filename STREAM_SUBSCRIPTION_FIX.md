# Stream Subscription Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## Problem
Getting "unsupported operation" error when using the Live Skeleton Viewer.

## Root Cause
The `SkeletonViewerScreen` was calling `.listen()` on broadcast streams directly in `initState()` without storing the subscriptions. This caused issues when:
- Hot reloading the app
- Navigating back and forth
- Widget rebuilding

### ❌ Old Code (Caused Error):
```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  _loadCameras();
  
  // ❌ No subscription reference - can't cancel later
  mqttService.connectionStream.listen((connected) {
    setState(() {
      isConnected = connected;
    });
  });
  
  // ❌ No subscription reference - can't cancel later
  mqttService.skeletonStream.listen((frame) {
    setState(() {
      currentFrame = frame;
    });
  });
}

@override
void dispose() {
  mqttService.dispose();  // ❌ Streams not properly cancelled
  super.dispose();
}
```

**Problems**:
- Stream subscriptions not stored
- Can't cancel subscriptions in dispose
- Memory leaks on hot reload
- Multiple listeners on same streams
- "Unsupported operation" errors

## Solution

### ✅ New Code (Fixed):
```dart
import 'dart:async';  // ✅ Added for StreamSubscription

class _SkeletonViewerScreenState extends State<SkeletonViewerScreen> {
  // ... existing fields ...
  
  // ✅ Store stream subscriptions for proper cleanup
  StreamSubscription<bool>? _connectionSubscription;
  StreamSubscription<SkeletonFrame>? _skeletonSubscription;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _loadCameras();
    
    // ✅ Store subscription reference
    _connectionSubscription = mqttService.connectionStream.listen((connected) {
      if (mounted) {  // ✅ Check if widget is still mounted
        setState(() {
          isConnected = connected;
        });
      }
    });
    
    // ✅ Store subscription reference
    _skeletonSubscription = mqttService.skeletonStream.listen((frame) {
      if (mounted) {  // ✅ Check if widget is still mounted
        setState(() {
          currentFrame = frame;
        });
      }
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // ✅ Cancel stream subscriptions first
    _connectionSubscription?.cancel();
    _skeletonSubscription?.cancel();
    
    // ✅ Then dispose MQTT service
    mqttService.dispose();
    
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```

## What Changed

### 1. ✅ Added Import
```dart
import 'dart:async';  // For StreamSubscription
```

### 2. ✅ Added Subscription Fields
```dart
StreamSubscription<bool>? _connectionSubscription;
StreamSubscription<SkeletonFrame>? _skeletonSubscription;
```

### 3. ✅ Store Subscriptions in initState
```dart
_connectionSubscription = mqttService.connectionStream.listen(...);
_skeletonSubscription = mqttService.skeletonStream.listen(...);
```

### 4. ✅ Added `mounted` Checks
```dart
if (mounted) {
  setState(() { ... });
}
```
This prevents calling `setState()` on disposed widgets.

### 5. ✅ Cancel Subscriptions in dispose
```dart
_connectionSubscription?.cancel();
_skeletonSubscription?.cancel();
```

## Why This Fixes the Error

### Before (Broken):
```
User navigates to Live Skeleton Viewer
  ↓
initState() calls stream.listen()
  ↓
Stream listener created (no reference stored)
  ↓
User hot reloads or navigates away
  ↓
dispose() called
  ↓
Stream listener NOT cancelled (no reference)
  ↓
User navigates back
  ↓
initState() calls stream.listen() AGAIN
  ↓
❌ ERROR: Stream already has listener
❌ "Unsupported operation"
```

### After (Fixed):
```
User navigates to Live Skeleton Viewer
  ↓
initState() calls stream.listen()
  ↓
Stream listener created AND stored in _subscription field
  ↓
User hot reloads or navigates away
  ↓
dispose() called
  ↓
_subscription?.cancel() → ✅ Listener properly removed
  ↓
User navigates back
  ↓
initState() calls stream.listen()
  ↓
✅ SUCCESS: New listener can be created
✅ No errors!
```

## Stream Lifecycle Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- Store `StreamSubscription` references
- Cancel subscriptions in `dispose()`
- Check `mounted` before calling `setState()`
- Use `?.cancel()` for nullable subscriptions

### ❌ DON'T:
- Call `.listen()` without storing the subscription
- Forget to cancel subscriptions
- Call `setState()` on disposed widgets
- Create multiple listeners without cancelling

## Testing

### Run the App:
```bash
cd Frontend
flutter run -d macos
```

### Test Scenarios:
1. ✅ Navigate to Live Skeleton Viewer → Should work
2. ✅ Hot reload (press 'r') → Should not crash
3. ✅ Navigate back → Should not error
4. ✅ Navigate to viewer again → Should work
5. ✅ Connect to camera → Should receive data
6. ✅ Disconnect and reconnect → Should work

### Expected Console Output:
```
✓ MQTT connection successful!
✓ Connected to MQTT
✓ Subscribed to skeleton/camera/C001
→ Published stream token
📦 Frame 1234: 1 person(s), 160 bytes
  Person 42: 15/18 keypoints visible
```

**NO "unsupported operation" errors!** ✅

## Files Modified

1. **Frontend/lib/screens/skeleton_viewer_screen.dart**
   - Added `dart:async` import
   - Added `_connectionSubscription` field
   - Added `_skeletonSubscription` field
   - Stored subscriptions in `initState()`
   - Added `mounted` checks
   - Cancelled subscriptions in `dispose()`

## Status: ✅ FIXED

The "unsupported operation" error is now resolved. The app properly manages stream subscriptions and cleans them up when the widget is disposed.

## Related Issues

This is a **common Flutter pattern** that applies to all stream listeners:

```dart
// ❌ BAD - Memory leak
myStream.listen((data) { ... });

// ✅ GOOD - Proper cleanup
StreamSubscription? subscription;
subscription = myStream.listen((data) { ... });
// ... later in dispose():
subscription?.cancel();
```
